## Read in data

``` r
if (!file.exists("mtsamples.csv"))
  download.file(
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/00_mtsamples/mtsamples.csv",
    destfile = "mtsamples.csv",
    method   = "libcurl",
    timeout  = 60
    )
mtsamples <- read.csv("mtsamples.csv")
mts <- as_tibble(mtsamples)
```

## What specialties do we have? What are the frequencies of each?

``` r
library(dplyr)
specialties <- count(mts, medical_specialty)

specialties %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
      knitr::kable()
```

There are 40 medical specialties. The frequency is not evenly
distributed. Surgery is most common with 1103 entries, Hospice -
Palliative Care is the least frequent with 6 entries. Some are related -
ie Consult - History and Physical and Discharge Summary are not
specialty-specific.

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
specialties %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y= fct_reorder(medical_specialty, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

    ## Selecting by n

![](Lab06_files/figure-gfm/graph%20specialties-1.png)<!-- --> \##
Tokenize words in transcription and look at top 20

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=fct_reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](Lab06_files/figure-gfm/tokenize-1.png)<!-- --> There are a lot of
stop words here. The top word is ???the??? while we do see ???patient???. We
should get rid of the stop words.

## Remove stop words

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  filter(!grepl(pattern = "^[0-9]+$", x=word)) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=fct_reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](Lab06_files/figure-gfm/remove%20stopwords-1.png)<!-- --> These look
more likel medical terms. Numbers were removed from the list of words.

## Repeat question 2, but this time tokenize into bi-grams. how does the result change if you look at tri-grams?

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2) %>%
  count(bigram, sort=TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=fct_reorder(bigram, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](Lab06_files/figure-gfm/bigrams-1.png)<!-- --> ???The patient??? was the
top bigram. There are a lot of non-interesting bigrams (of the, in the).

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(trigram, transcription, n=3) %>%
  count(trigram, sort=TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=fct_reorder(trigram, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](Lab06_files/figure-gfm/trigrams-1.png)<!-- --> Top 20 trigrams seem
more medical.

## Using the results you got from questions 4. Pick a word and count the words that appears after and before it.

``` r
ptbigram <- 
  mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2) %>%
  separate(bigram, into = c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  select(word1, word2) %>%
  filter(word1 == "patient" | word2 == "patient")
```

Words appearing before patient

``` r
ptbigram %>%
  filter(word2 == "patient") %>%
  count(word1, sort=TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word1" = "word")) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=fct_reorder(word1, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](Lab06_files/figure-gfm/bigrams%20before%20patient-1.png)<!-- -->
Words appearing after patient

``` r
ptbigram %>%
  filter(word1 == "patient") %>%
  count(word2, sort=TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word2" = "word")) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=fct_reorder(word2, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](Lab06_files/figure-gfm/bigrams%20after%20patient-1.png)<!-- -->
Looks reasonable!

## Which words are most used in each of the specialties. you can use group_by() and top_n() from dplyr to have the calculations be done within each specialty. Remember to remove stopwords. How about the most 5 used words?

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  group_by(medical_specialty) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  filter(!grepl(pattern = "^[0-9]+$", x=word)) %>%
  top_n(5, n) %>%
  arrange(medical_specialty, desc(n)) %>%
knitr::kable()
```
